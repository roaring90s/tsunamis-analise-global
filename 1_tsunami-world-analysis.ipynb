        "\n",
        "Durante a an√°lise dos dados dos tsunamis, foi poss√≠vel observar diversos padr√µes e rela√ß√µes importantes entre as magnitudes dos terremotos e seus impactos. Atrav√©s das visualiza√ß√µes geradas, destacamos alguns pontos-chave:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Distribui√ß√£o das Magnitudes dos Terremotos**:\n",
        "   A an√°lise da magnitude dos terremotos demonstrou que a maioria dos eventos de tsunami est√° relacionada a terremotos de magnitudes elevadas, especialmente acima de 7.0. Essa informa√ß√£o √© crucial para entender a correla√ß√£o entre a intensidade do terremoto e o impacto subsequente do tsunami.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Impacto Humano**:\n",
        "   Observou-se que, em geral, os tsunamis mais devastadores, em termos de n√∫mero de mortes, est√£o associados a terremotos de maior magnitude. O gr√°fico de Magnitude vs Mortes vs Altura da √Ågua demonstrou que, embora a altura da √°gua tenha um papel importante, a magnitude do terremoto parece ser o fator determinante para o n√∫mero de mortes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Altura da √Ågua**:\n",
        "   A altura m√°xima da √°gua foi um fator relevante para os impactos, mas n√£o teve uma correla√ß√£o t√£o forte quanto a magnitude do terremoto. Isso sugere que, embora tsunamis com grandes alturas de √°gua possam ser mais destrutivos, a proximidade do epicentro e a intensidade do terremoto tamb√©m desempenham pap√©is cruciais.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Pa√≠ses Mais Afetados**:\n",
        "   O gr√°fico de distribui√ß√£o de tsunamis por pa√≠s revelou que algumas regi√µes, como o Sudeste Asi√°tico e o Jap√£o, s√£o mais frequentemente afetadas por tsunamis. Isso pode ser explicado pela localiza√ß√£o geol√≥gica dessas regi√µes, que est√£o pr√≥ximas √†s placas tect√¥nicas respons√°veis pelos terremotos submarinos.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Conclus√£o Geral**:\n",
        "   Em resumo, os dados mostram que os tsunamis mais devastadores est√£o relacionados a terremotos de maior magnitude, com uma forte rela√ß√£o entre a magnitude do terremoto e o n√∫mero de mortes. Pa√≠ses pr√≥ximos a zonas s√≠smicas ativas, como o Jap√£o e a Indon√©sia, est√£o mais suscet√≠veis a esses desastres.\n",
        "\n",
        "Esta an√°lise pode ser um ponto de partida para estudar a prepara√ß√£o e resposta a tsunamis, al√©m de guiar pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas para mitigar os impactos desses desastres naturais.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Limita√ß√µes da An√°lise\n",
        "\n",
        "√â importante notar que a an√°lise foi baseada em dados dispon√≠veis, e valores ausentes ou inconsistentes podem ter afetado as conclus√µes. Al√©m disso, a intera√ß√£o entre fatores geogr√°ficos, ambientais e humanos pode ser complexa e requer um estudo mais aprofundado.\n",
